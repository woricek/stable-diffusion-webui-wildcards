# Wildcards
An extension version of a script from https://github.com/jtkelm2/stable-diffusion-webui-1/blob/main/scripts/wildcards.py

Allows you to use `__name__` syntax in your prompt to get a line from a file named `name.txt` in the wildcards directory for each iteration.

## Install manually
To install by hand:

From your base `stable-diffusion-webui` directory, run the following command to install:
```
git clone https://github.com/woricek/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards extensions/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards
```

Then restart the webui.
